## About

Hi, I’m Lior Batat, a MSc Student in the Mulecular Neuroscience track at the Weizmann School of Science.  
I did my BSc in Biomedical Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during which I did a Project in [Prof. Yonatan Kupchik's](https://www.kupchiklab.com/) lab about Synaptic currents and cocaine addiction.

## Rotations

### Rotation 1: [Schmidt MRI Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/labs/schmidt/)
Focusing on ultra-high field MRI to better understand the human brain function. I will be focusing spesifically on fMRI.

### Rotation 2: [Tali Kimchi's Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/labs/kimchi/)
Focusing on social behaviors, spesifically sexually dimorphic behavior in blind mole rats.

### Rotation 3: TBD
I haven't found a lab for my third rotation yet. I'm looking for a neuroscience lab with a focus on a link between brain function and behavior.
